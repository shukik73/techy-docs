# State of Local Intelligence 2026
## Architectural Recommendations for Autonomous Agent Deployment
## Status: PARKED — revisit when gaming laptop specs confirmed

### Key Takeaway
- DeepSeek V3.2 recommended for reasoning/safety
- Llama 4 Scout for massive context (10M tokens)
- vLLM over Ollama for multi-agent serving
- Minimum: single RTX 3090/4090 + 64GB RAM for entry-level
- Optimal: dual GPUs + 256GB RAM

### Hardware Available
- Gaming laptops in Techy Miramar store (specs TBD)

### Next Steps
1. Get specs on available laptops (GPU model, VRAM, RAM)
2. Match to deployment configuration
3. If viable: install Linux + vLLM + DeepSeek or Scout
4. Run Kai/Jay locally as backup or primary inference
