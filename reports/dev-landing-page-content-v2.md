### H1: Expert PS5 HDMI Repair in Miramar — Get Back to Gaming Fast

Nothing kills game night faster than a PS5 that shows no signal. Whether you accidentally bent the HDMI port, noticed flickering output, or get a blank screen every time you power on, Techy Miramar's board-level technicians can diagnose and fix the problem — usually within 2-4 days. We've restored hundreds of consoles for South Florida gamers, and every PS5 HDMI repair leaves our bench with a written warranty on parts and labor.

### H2: Common PS5 HDMI Problems We Fix

Your PS5 might need HDMI port service if you're experiencing any of these symptoms:

- **No signal on TV** — PS5 powers on (blue light, disc drive spins) but the TV stays black or shows "No Signal."
- **Flickering or static display** — Picture cuts in and out, shows horizontal lines, or flashes purple/green artifacts.
- **Loose or damaged port** — The HDMI cable wiggles, doesn't click in securely, or the metal housing is bent.
- **Intermittent connection** — Works at certain angles but drops out when the cable moves.
- **No video after update** — Software update completed but video output disappeared.

Bring the console in and we'll run a free diagnostic to confirm whether the issue is the HDMI port, the HDMI IC (encoder chip), the ribbon cable, or a combination.

### H2: Our PS5 HDMI Repair Process

1. **Free Diagnostic:** We inspect the port under magnification, test the HDMI encoder IC, and check the motherboard for related damage — all at no charge.
2. **Transparent Quote:** You'll receive an itemized estimate covering parts, labor, and expected turnaround before we touch a soldering iron.
3. **Micro-Soldering Repair:** Our technicians work in an ESD-safe workstation environment using hot-air rework stations, precision soldering irons, and flux to remove the damaged port and install a brand-new replacement rated for 4K 120Hz output.
4. **Full System Test:** After repair, we test video output at multiple resolutions (1080p, 4K, HDR), verify audio passthrough, confirm all USB and LAN ports function, and run a game to stress-test the connection.
5. **Pickup & Warranty:** You leave with a fully working PS5 and written warranty documentation.

### H2: FAQ – PS5 HDMI Repair

#### H3: How do I know if my PS5 HDMI port is broken?

Yes. We perform component-level micro-soldering to replace just the damaged port or chip, preserving your original motherboard and all saved data.

No. HDMI port repair doesn't affect your internal storage. All games, saves, and account data remain intact.

#### H3: Do you also repair PS4 and Xbox HDMI ports?
Absolutely. We handle HDMI port replacement on PS4, PS4 Pro, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, and Xbox Series X using the same micro-soldering techniques.

Our PS5 HDMI repairs come with a limited warranty covering the replaced port and associated labor. Ask your technician for specific terms at pickup.

### H1: Water Damage Repair in Miramar — Act Fast, Save Your Device

A phone in the pool, a laptop hit by a spilled coffee, a tablet caught in the rain — water damage is one of the most time-sensitive repair emergencies we handle. The faster you get your device to Techy Miramar, the higher the chance we can save it. Our technicians perform professional water damage repair using ultrasonic cleaning, board-level micro-soldering, and component-by-component inspection in an ESD-safe workstation environment — giving your device the best possible shot at a full recovery.

### H2: Why Speed Matters with Water Damage

Water doesn't just short-circuit your device — it starts a corrosion process that gets worse every hour. Here's what happens after water exposure:

- **0-2 hours:** Mineral deposits begin forming on circuit board traces and connectors.
- **2-24 hours:** Corrosion accelerates, attacking solder joints, IC pins, and flex cable contacts.
- **24-72 hours:** Permanent component failure becomes increasingly likely as oxidation spreads.

**What to do immediately:**
1. Power off the device — do NOT try to charge it or turn it on.
2. Remove the case and any accessories.
3. Gently shake out excess water (don't use a hair dryer or rice — both can cause more harm).
4. Bring it to Techy Miramar as soon as possible.

### H2: Our Water Damage Repair Process

1. **Emergency Intake & Free Assessment:** We open the device, inspect for visible water intrusion, and evaluate corrosion levels at no charge.
2. **Ultrasonic Cleaning:** The logic board and affected components are placed in a professional ultrasonic cleaning bath with specialized solution to dissolve mineral deposits and corrosion at a microscopic level.
3. **Drying & Inspection:** After cleaning, we dry components with filtered compressed air and inspect every connection under magnification for remaining corrosion or damaged traces.
4. **Component-Level Repair:** If corrosion has damaged specific ICs, capacitors, or connectors, our micro-soldering technicians replace them individually — saving your board and your data.
5. **Reassembly & Testing:** We reassemble the device and run comprehensive diagnostics: display, touch, audio, cameras, charging, cellular/Wi-Fi, and biometrics.
6. **Pickup & Aftercare:** You receive a detailed report of what was found and repaired, plus a limited warranty on replaced components.

### H2: Devices We Treat for Water Damage

- **iPhones** (all models from iPhone 6 through iPhone 15 Pro Max)
- **Samsung Galaxy** phones (S-series, A-series, Z Flip/Fold, Note)
- **Google Pixel, Motorola, OnePlus** and other Android phones
- **iPads & Samsung Galaxy Tabs**
- **MacBooks & Windows Laptops** — keyboard spills, rain exposure, humidity damage
- **Gaming Consoles** — liquid spills on PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch
- **Smartwatches** — Apple Watch, Galaxy Watch seal failures

### H2: Water Damage Repair Pricing

| Service | Typical Price Range* | Avg. Turnaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phone Water Damage Treatment | $99 - $249 | 1-3 days |
| Tablet Water Damage Treatment | $129 - $279 | 2-4 days |
| Laptop Water Damage Treatment | $149 - $399 | 2-5 days |
| Board-Level Micro-Soldering (add-on) | $79 - $199 | Included in turnaround |

*Final pricing depends on severity of corrosion and components requiring replacement. Free diagnosis included.

### H2: Honest Success Rates

We believe in transparency. Water damage repair success depends on several factors:

- **How quickly you brought it in** — devices treated within hours have the highest recovery rates.
- **Type of liquid** — clean water is less damaging than saltwater, coffee, or sugary drinks.
- **Whether the device was powered on while wet** — turning on a wet device can cause additional short circuits.

Our overall success rate for water-damaged devices brought in within 24 hours is strong, but we'll always give you an honest assessment before you commit to repair. **If we can't fix it, you only pay for completed work.**

### H2: Don't Put Your Phone in Rice

Let's clear up the biggest water damage myth: **rice does not fix water-damaged electronics.** Rice doesn't address corrosion, can introduce starch dust into ports and speakers, and gives a false sense of security while internal damage worsens. Professional ultrasonic cleaning is the only proven method to properly treat water exposure at the component level.

### H2: Visit Techy Miramar — Every Minute Counts

- **Address:** 16263 Miramar Pkwy, Miramar, FL 33027
- **Phone:** 954-392-5520
- **Hours:** Mon-Sat 10 AM-7 PM, Sun 12 PM-6 PM

### H2: FAQ – Water Damage Repair

#### H3: Can you recover data from a water-damaged phone?
In many cases, yes. Even if the phone won't power on, we can often access the logic board, clean it, and retrieve data. Success depends on corrosion severity and how quickly the device reaches us.

#### H3: Is water damage covered under phone warranty?
Most manufacturer warranties exclude water damage, even on "water-resistant" phones. We provide affordable out-of-warranty repair as an alternative to full device replacement.

#### H3: How much does water damage repair cost?
Phone water damage treatment starts at $99. Final cost depends on the number of components affected. We provide a free diagnosis and transparent quote before starting any work.

#### H3: My phone fell in saltwater — can you still fix it?
Saltwater is more corrosive than fresh water, but fast action improves outcomes significantly. Rinse the exterior gently with fresh water, power it off, and bring it in immediately.

#### H3: Should I try to dry my phone with a hair dryer?
No. Heat can push moisture deeper into the device and damage heat-sensitive components. Power off the device and bring it to us as-is.

#### H3: How long does water damage repair take?
Most phone water damage repairs take 1-3 days. Laptops and tablets may take 2-5 days depending on severity. We'll give you a timeline estimate after the initial assessment.
