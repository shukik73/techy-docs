## 🏭 Competitor / Market Intel

### Product Hunt
- No direct competitors launched in the review management or repair-shop-automation space this cycle. The PH landscape is dominated by AI coding tools and general SaaS.
- **TrustIndex.io** continues to show up as a competitor to ReviewGuard in Reddit threads — their Stripe issues are a window of opportunity.

### Indie Hackers
- "2026 State of SaaS Report" trending — worth reading for market sizing data for ReviewGuard/LeadCatcher pitch decks.

## 💡 Money-Maker Ideas (Trend-Based)

### 1. "Review Protection" Feature for ReviewGuard
Google is actively removing legitimate reviews (multiple threads about this). Build a feature that: monitors review count daily, alerts when reviews disappear, provides templates to appeal to Google support. **Unique differentiator** nobody else is marketing.

### 2. Iron Secretary → r/smallbusiness Content Funnel
The AI answering service thread proves demand. Create a comparison page: "Iron Secretary vs Generic AI Answering Services for Repair Shops" targeting the exact keywords people are searching. Run it as a Reddit ad too.

### 3. LeadCatcher "Too Many Leads" Tier
One commenter said they have too many leads and need AI to manage them. This suggests a premium LeadCatcher tier focused on lead scoring/qualification rather than just generation. Quick win: add a lead prioritization feature.
