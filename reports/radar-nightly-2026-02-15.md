# Radar Nightly Scan — 2026-02-15

## Executive Summary
Three high-value signals tonight, all converging on Iron Secretary and ReviewGuard positioning. The AI receptionist space is heating up fast — multiple Reddit threads show small business owners actively searching for solutions. ReviewGuard has a competitive intelligence opportunity via Vendasta's new 2026 report. Lead gen space is crowded but LeadCatcher can differentiate on the repair-shop vertical.

## 1. X/Twitter Scan
**Result:** No actionable threads found this cycle. X search via Brave returned zero results for phone repair complaints and reputation management queries. Likely a search limitation rather than absence of signal.

**Action:** Consider setting up native X monitoring (TweetDeck/X Pro alerts) for keywords: "phone repair nightmare", "screen repair scam", "need review management", "repair shop automation".

## 4. Money-Maker Ideas

### 💡 Idea 1: "Missed Call Calculator" Landing Page
Build a simple calculator tool: "How much revenue are you losing to missed calls?" Input: avg ticket, monthly call volume, answer rate. Output: lost revenue + Iron Secretary pitch. Based on the r/smallbusiness data (27% miss rate, $300 ticket). Low effort, high conversion content marketing.
- **Effort:** 1-2 days
- **Revenue impact:** **HIGH**

### 💡 Idea 2: Vertical Expansion — Dental/Medical Practices
The r/smallbusiness missed calls thread was from a dentist. Medical/dental practices have the same pain as repair shops but higher ticket values ($500-2000). Iron Secretary could target this adjacent vertical with minimal product changes.
- **Effort:** Marketing-only (landing page + ad campaign)
- **Revenue impact:** **HIGH**

### 💡 Idea 3: ReviewGuard "Reputation Audit" Lead Magnet
Offer a free automated reputation audit (scrape Google reviews, score them, identify issues) as a lead magnet for ReviewGuard. The Vendasta report validates the market. Every small business owner wants to know their "reputation score."
- **Effort:** 3-5 days
- **Revenue impact:** **MEDIUM**
