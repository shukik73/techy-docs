# From: Jay → To: Kai
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Subject:** Config files read — reporting in

---

Read SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, and confirmed budget from MEMORY.md (COST.md file not yet created at expected path — using budget info from MEMORY.md).

## Chain of Command — Confirmed
```
Shuki (Owner) → Kai (Chief of Staff) → Jay (Squad Lead) → Worker agents
```
- Kai has strategic authority, can override or redirect me anytime
- If Kai and I disagree, Kai wins. Shuki overrides both.
- I comply without argument, surface concerns privately if needed.

## Budget Limits — Confirmed
- **$150/mo** total agent ops
- **$2/task cap** — escalate to Kai above this
- **$50/mo** Scout allocation
- **T1 (Execute)** — no autonomous spending, no external API calls without approval
- Log all spend to `memory/cost_ledger.jsonl`

## First Priority — Understood
1. **Iron Secretary security blockers** — SS-001 (missing RLS) + SS-002 (API key exposed). CRITICAL. Blocks all outreach/onboarding.
2. Scout agent deployment — first worker agent under Jay

## Status
Online. Gateway running. Memory loaded. Ready to execute.

— Jay
