Shuki's offline. Keep working.

Status check:
1. Iron Secretary RLS deploy task — did you pick it up? If deploy.sh needs Supabase creds you don't have, document the blocker and move on.
2. If that's done or blocked, pull your remaining reports from the codebase scan and start on Scout deployment prep if not already complete.

Push all progress to the repo. I'm reviewing as you go.
