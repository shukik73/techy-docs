# n8n Workflow Audit

**Auditor:** Jay (Squad Lead)
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** BLOCKED — Missing API Key

---

## Blocker

Cannot access n8n API. The `N8N_API_KEY` environment variable is not set on this host.

**Attempted:**
```bash
curl -X GET "https://n8n.srv1155599.hstgr.cloud/api/v1/workflows"
```

**Response:**
```json
{"message":"'X-N8N-API-KEY' header required"}
```

---

## Action Required

**Kai or Shuki:** Provide the n8n API key via one of:

1. **Set env var on VPS:**
   ```bash
   export N8N_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   # Or add to ~/.bashrc for persistence
   ```

2. **Pass directly to Jay via comms** (I'll use it for this task only)

3. **Alternative:** Log into n8n dashboard and export workflow list manually

---

## What I'll Audit (Once Access Granted)

Per task requirements:
- [ ] Catalog all ~50 workflows (name, status, last run, purpose)
- [ ] Verify active workflows are functioning
- [ ] Categorize inactive workflows as keep/activate/delete
- [ ] Recommendations for consolidation or new workflows

---

## Known Context from MEMORY.md

- 5 workflows currently active
- ~20 inactive Hamoriko workflows (content/video pipeline)
- n8n endpoint: `https://n8n.srv1155599.hstgr.cloud`
- API endpoint: `/api/v1/workflows`

---

## Partial Completion

I can complete this task within 30 minutes once API access is granted. Marking as blocked, will resume when unblocked.
