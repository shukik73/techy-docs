## Jay VPS Deployment

### Setup Progress
- Jay's VPS: `srv1318455.hstgr.cloud`, user `clawd`, OpenClaw 2026.2.14
- Jay's config files written to `~/.openclaw/workspace/agents/jay/` (SOUL.md, COST.md, MEMORY.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md)
- All pushed to GitHub `shukik73/techy-docs` (commit `b6399a3`)
- Jay's Telegram bot is live — responds in DM, inconsistent in group chat
- Jay runs on Claude Sonnet 4

### VPS Blocker (OPEN)
- Root-owned `openclaw-gateway` process (PID 9285) holding port 18789
- Device token mismatch error: `unauthorized: device token mismatch`
- systemd user services unavailable on VPS
- Fix: `sudo kill 9285` → `openclaw devices` token rotation → restart in tmux
- Shuki troubleshooting from home

### Telegram Groups
- Squad HQ: chat ID `-5167215113` (group "J&K")
- Second group: chat ID `-5273510564` (group "K&J") — Jay responded here
- Full briefing sent to Squad HQ for Jay

## Jay Configuration

### SOUL.md Key Points
- Chain of Command: Shuki → Kai → Jay → Workers
- Trust Levels: T1 (Execute only) → T2 → T3, Jay starts at T1
- No autonomous spending at T1
- Mission Control 15-min check-in duty
- Communication via shared Telegram group

### COST.md Budget
- $150/mo total agent ops
- $2/task cap
- $50/mo Scout (biggest slice — revenue-generating)
- $30/mo Jay overhead
- $20/mo reserve
- Escalation thresholds defined

## Parts Sourcing Analysis (Completed)

### eBay
- 237 orders, $22,614 total
- Saved to `reports/ebay-purchase-analysis.md`

### Amazon
- 605 items, $44,816 total
- MacBook screens = 32% of spend ($14,173)
- Seven Puppy dominant supplier (63 orders, $11,455)
- TEAMGROUP AX2 = SSD workhorse
- 82% of Amazon spend is repair parts
- Top repeats: A2338 Pro screen (17x, $3,333), A2337 Air screen (12x, $2,265)
- Price swings $143–$235 for same model — Scout opportunity
- Saved to `reports/amazon-purchase-analysis.md`

### Combined: ~$67K/year ($22.6K eBay + $44.8K Amazon)

## Parts Scout Spec
- Written to `reports/parts-scout-spec.md`
- Sources: eBay, Amazon, FB Marketplace, OfferUp, Craigslist
- Phone parts (screens) sourced from Mobile Sentrix & Injured Gadgets — no agent needed
- Laptop/PC parts = the pain point
- MacBook screen grades: New/Grade A preferred, B+/B/B- if customer agrees

## Reports Written
- `reports/parts-scout-spec.md`
- `reports/jay-setup-guide.md`
- `reports/mission-control-setup.md`
- `reports/ebay-purchase-analysis.md`
- `reports/amazon-purchase-analysis.md`

## Key Decisions
- Task tracking rule: "mentioned once AND assigned" = expected; brainstormed ≠ committed
- Telnyx as Twilio backup ($0.004/SMS)
- Local LLM parked for Q2+ (gaming laptops viable, MacBook Air insufficient)
- DeepSeek V3.2 recommended when local deployment happens
- Cost dashboard `/api/costs` deferred until Jay generates spend data

## Next Steps Queue
1. Fix Jay VPS gateway (kill root process, rotate token)
2. Get Jay acknowledging in Squad HQ group
3. Jay reads config files, begins T1 ops
4. Deploy Scout as Jay's first worker
5. Connect Mission Control to OpenClaw gateway
6. Fix Iron Secretary security blockers (SS-001 RLS, SS-002 API key)
7. Missed Call Calculator landing page (Iron Secretary)
8. Reddit threads for Iron Secretary
9. RG cold email: burner domain + Instantly.ai
10. Wire `/api/costs` in mission-control
