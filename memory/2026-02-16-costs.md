# 2026-02-16 — Cost Alert

## Problem
~$40 spent today. WAY over budget ($150/mo = ~$5/day target).

## Root Causes
1. Jay SSH sessions: 180s timeout, complex multi-tool tasks on Opus = expensive
2. Kai polling loops: 40+ polls waiting for Jay = wasted turns
3. Everything on Opus — no model tiering

## Fixes
- Cap Jay SSH tasks to 60s timeout, simple focused questions
- Poll once, wait, check back — no loops
- Use cheaper models for sub-agents (Sonnet/Haiku for routine work)
- Batch updates instead of individual messages
- Track daily spend religiously
