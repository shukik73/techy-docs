## Business Research

### Techy Miramar
- **Website:** https://techymiramar.com — **LIVE ✅**
- Offers: cell phone repair, computer repair, game console repair, tablet repair, device buying/selling, protection plans, installations
- Title: "Best Electronics Repair Shop in Miramar, FL"
- Has student-specific protection plans
- **Google Reviews:** Could not check (no Brave API key configured). Recommend manual check or configuring `openclaw configure --section web`.

### GetReviewGuard.com
- **Website:** https://www.getreviewguard.com — **LIVE ✅**
- Title: "ReviewGuard | Automated Google Reviews for Local Businesses"
- Appears to be a landing page / early-stage product. Minimal content extracted.

### LeadCatcher.com
- **Website:** DNS not resolving ❌ (`ENOTFOUND`)
- Domain appears to be unregistered or expired. **Action needed:** Verify domain ownership/renewal status.

### Iron Secretary
- **Website:** https://ironsecretary.com — Connection failed ❌
- No public web presence found. Domain may not be configured.
- **Action needed:** Determine if this is still an active project and whether hosting is set up.

## Competitive Landscape — Reputation Management SaaS

> ⚠️ Could not perform web search (Brave API key not configured). Below are known competitors from general knowledge. **Recommend configuring Brave API key for deeper research.**

| Competitor | Focus | Pricing (approx.) |
|---|---|---|
| **Birdeye** | Reviews, listings, messaging for local biz | ~$299-$399/mo per location |
| **Podium** | Reviews, messaging, payments | ~$249-$599/mo |
| **Reputation.com** | Enterprise reputation management | Custom pricing (expensive) |
| **GatherUp** | Review generation & management for SMBs/agencies | ~$60-$175/mo per location |
| **Grade.us** | White-label review management for agencies | ~$110-$315/mo |

**ReviewGuard differentiator:** Automated Google review solicitation specifically for local businesses — simpler and cheaper than the above. Key opportunity is the SMB segment priced out of Birdeye/Podium.

## Infrastructure Work Completed
- Created all missing governance files (audit.jsonl, failsafe.jsonl, cost_ledger.jsonl, episodes.jsonl, friction.jsonl, interventions.jsonl, runs/)
- Set up morning brief cron job (daily 7AM EST, isolated session)
- Created HEARTBEAT.md with system health checks
- Verified "Shuki files/" contents match workspace destinations

## Workspace: "Shuki files/" Directory
All files from `Shuki files/` have been copied to their proper workspace locations. Verified via diff — the only differences in `memory/` and `proactive/` are the new infrastructure files we just created (which is expected). **Recommendation:** The `Shuki files/` directory can be safely removed. (Noting only — not deleting per L1 trust level.)

---

## Action Items for Shuki
1. **Configure Brave API key** — `openclaw configure --section web` — needed for web search in cron jobs and research tasks
2. **Check LeadCatcher.com domain** — DNS is not resolving; may need renewal
3. **Check Iron Secretary hosting** — ironsecretary.com is not responding
4. **Verify Techy Miramar Google reviews** — manually check rating and review count
5. **Remove `Shuki files/` when ready** — all contents verified in place

## Pre-Compaction Memory Flush

### Key Facts Established Today
- Shuki's GitHub: shukik73 (SSH auth configured)
- Repos: mission-control, Iron-Secretary-V2, LeadCatcher, shukik73-reviewguard-app, techy-docs, TrustLoop
- Correct product URLs:
  - LeadCatcher: https://www.leadcatcher.app/
  - ReviewGuard: https://www.getreviewguard.com/
  - Iron Secretary: https://www.ironsecretary.app/
  - Mission Control: https://dashboard-ten-phi-45.vercel.app/
- Mission Control: 15 agents defined, 2 active (Scout Baz, Emilio), Vercel + Supabase
- Telegram bot token configured, Shuki's Telegram ID: 6103393903
- Gateway port changed to 28173, bind=lan
- Shuki prefers Telegram for images, webchat for conversation

### Code Review Summary
- **ReviewGuard (B+):** Most complete SaaS. Node/Express, PostgreSQL, Twilio, Stripe, OpenAI. Has billing, auth, onboarding. Closest to revenue.
- **LeadCatcher (6.5/10):** Next.js 16, Supabase, Twilio. Great landing page + pricing ($299/$499). 3 security blockers: missing Twilio webhook validation, open redirect, settings crash.
- **Iron Secretary (C+):** Vite/React/Supabase. Most ambitious, least ready. CRITICAL: missing RLS on 3 tables, API key exposure. Needs major refactor.
- **Mission Control:** Clean Vite/React/Supabase dashboard. Kanban board + agent sidebar. Contains all agent prompts as markdown.
- **techy-docs:** Fix prompts + security roadmap. 5 blockers identified Feb 11, none fixed yet.

### Security Blockers (Corrected per Shuki verification)
**LeadCatcher: ALL 3 RESOLVED (fixes predated audit — audit was stale)**
- Twilio: official SDK validateRequest() already present + UUID/E.164 param validation added
- Open redirect: getSafeRedirectPath() 5-layer validation + 15 unit tests
- Settings crash: useCallback + cancellation signal pattern
- ESLint: 0 errors. Middleware: current Next.js pattern. Production-ready.
- Remaining work: Stripe billing, RepairDesk integration (features, not security)

**Iron Secretary: 2 STILL OPEN**
1. SS-001: Missing RLS on 3 tables (CRITICAL, 2h)
2. SS-002: API key exposed in client (CRITICAL, 15m)

### Decisions / Direction
- Shuki wants Kai to own Mission Control and Iron Secretary
- Dev workflow: Codex writes code → Opus validates → Shuki approves PRs
- Model routing: Opus (main), Sonnet (subagents), Codex (free dev)
- Subagents on Bedrock Sonnet failed all 5 review tasks (no output) — need to investigate model access or switch subagent model
- Shuki at work during setup, prefers async autonomous work from Kai
- Recommended priority: fix 5 security blockers → get ReviewGuard first customer → refactor Iron Secretary

### Mission Control — Verified State (Shuki-confirmed)
- Stack: React 19.2.4, Vite 6.2.0, TS 5.8.2, Supabase 2.95.3
- Components: AgentSidebar, DealCard, AuthGate (only 3)
- Kanban: Scout Inbox → Under Review → Needs Shuki → Done
- Telegram Bot: Full production (470 lines) — /status, /inbox, /urgent, inline approve/reject/askjay, Realtime subscription
- Schema: 10 tables, 4 views, 3 migration files. Core tables: scout_deals, missions, leads, deal_audit_log
- Revenue views: revenue_reconciliation, daily_revenue_summary — live but no UI

### Agent Deployment Reality (Verified)
| Agent | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Scout | Production — scout.ts cron (575 lines), eBay OAuth2 + Browse API |
| Emilio | Production — emilio.ts cron (561 lines), Google Sheets + n8n trigger |
| Midas | Runs via n8n + Apify (heartbeat from Emilio cron) — no standalone code |
| Pluto | Runs via n8n + GPT-4o (heartbeat from Emilio cron) — no standalone code |
| Telegram Bot | Production — 470 lines, Realtime subscription |
| Pixel, Buzz, Secretary | Markdown prompts only — no code |
| Jay, Kai, Valet, Radar, Penny, Echo, Hamoriko, Developer | Schema entries only — no prompts, no code |

**Key insight:** n8n IS in production — Emilio triggers it, Midas + Pluto run through it. Automation strategy should extend n8n, not replace it.

### n8n Instance
- URL: https://n8n.srv1155599.hstgr.cloud/
- Hosted on: Hostinger VPS (srv1155599)
- API key obtained and working
- 50 total workflows, 5 active:
  1. ReviewGuard Sales Machine v2 (KM0MSoOXp7VAsVCH) — updated Feb 12
  2. Iron Secretary Voice Note Digest (VsYcid3DaTyv1V3K)
  3. Parts Search Agent V3.1.1 Production (XwoxMVmJtoTlM53S)
  4. Daily Email Scan KYS Havana (hXzBp4eqrHrK86YA)
  5. SMS Broadcast RevenueBooster v2 (tyQpxDUxZJmMHB0h)
- ~20 inactive Hamoriko workflows (content/video pipeline — status TBD)
- No workflows named Emilio/Midas/Pluto — may be triggered via Mission Control crons directly

### Techy Miramar — Service Area
- Primary: Miramar, FL
- Secondary: Pembroke Pines, Miami Lakes
- ZIP: 33027 (Miramar)

### Agent Squad Architecture (decided)
- Pattern: Kai (orchestrator) → specialist agents via sessions_spawn / cron
- Inspired by SiteGPT model (14 agents, one orchestrator, shared dashboard)
- Mission Control = shared dashboard, extend for agent task read/write
- Build order: Sage (SEO) → Shield (Reviews) → Rex (Social) → Sentinel (Security) → Dev → Ledger

### Mandate Update (from Shuki, 8:51 PM)
- Target raised: $250K-$500K profit generated by the agent squad
- Directive: be more proactive, assertive, and opportunity-driven
- Nightly Radar scan: 1AM EST, scans X/Reddit/PH for revenue opportunities across all 4 businesses
- Kai must shift from reactive (wait for instructions) to proactive (find opportunities, propose actions, push execution)

### TODOs (Weekend)
- [ ] RG cold email setup: buy burner domain + Instantly.ai ($40/mo), wire n8n Sales Machine output to it
- [ ] Shuki deciding on platform — revisit Monday

### Infrastructure Setup Completed
- OpenClaw fully configured: Telegram, webchat, Brave search, heartbeat (1h), morning brief cron (7AM)
- Codex CLI installed globally
- All governance files loaded and in workspace
- Trust Level: L1 (suggest only), Assertiveness: 3 (Direct)
